title: "About myself"
---

I am a postdoctoral associate in the <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/16129" target="blank_">Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics</a> at Caâ€™ Foscari University of Venice, working with Ilaria Prosdocimi I received my PhD in Statistics at the Universiy of Padova in 2025, under the supervision of Bruno Scarpa and Matteo Fasiolo.

I am interested in developing flexible regression models for the analysis of complex data, with a focus on both theoretical and computational aspects. My recent work involves Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), distributional regression, and applications to environmental data.

Outside statistics, I love hiking and climbing, particularly in my home mountains: the Dolomites.
